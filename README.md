# WORK IN PROGRESS!

## Ngspotify

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.  
This project is based on the tutorial by Traversy Media published on Aug 12, 2016 and based on Angular 2. I reworked this project to make it work on Angular 6.1.2.  I am also adding functionality (work in progress) to deal with the fact that the Spotify API now requires an authentication token.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

<!--## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
